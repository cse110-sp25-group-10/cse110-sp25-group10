# ADR  
**Work distribution**  
**Date: 5/15/2025**

## Context / Problem  
Working on code projects individually often leads to uneven skill development, low engagement, and less effective collaboration. The team has struggled to distribute learning opportunities evenly and maintain engagement.

## Options Considered  
- Solo programming assignments  
- Traditional group projects  
- Optional study sessions  
- Scheduled pair programming sessions  

## Decision & Outcome  
Implement structured **pair programming sessions** as a core component of the workflow. Each week, team members will rotate partners to work together on designated code tasks.

## Pros & Cons  

### Pros  
- Promotes knowledge sharing and mentorship  
- Improves code quality through real-time review  
- Increases engagement and accountability  
- Helps build soft skills like communication and collaboration  

### Cons  
- Requires scheduling coordination  
- Some tasks may not pair well  
- Varying skill levels may lead to imbalance without careful planning
