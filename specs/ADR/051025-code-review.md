# Code Review
## Date: 5/10/2025

## Context/Problem
We need a way to review code and issues before merging it to the main development branch, so that it wonâ€™t really break any existing code.

## Options Considered
- Manual decision system based on the size of the project
- A designated person to review the code for devOps
## Decision & Outcome
- Human review decision system
- Where the amount of people that is needed for approval 1/2/3 is based on the size of the issue S/M/L
## Pros & Cons
- Pros
  - Minimize bus factor problem
  - More perspective on a fix for code, less errors
- Cons
  - A merge might take a while since most of the work is asynchronous
  - Slower progress overall
