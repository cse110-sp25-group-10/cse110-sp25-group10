# ADR  
**UI design**  
**Date: 5/8/2025**

## Context / Problem  
Designing a consistent and user-friendly interface requires a collaborative, flexible, and accessible tool that supports rapid prototyping and iteration. The team needs a centralized platform to collaborate on UI/UX design, provide feedback, and hand off designs to developers efficiently.

## Options Considered  
- Designing directly in code (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- Using Adobe XD  
- Using Sketch  
- Using Figma  

## Decision & Outcome  
We will use **Figma** as the primary tool for UI/UX design. It will be used for creating wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and sharing design specifications with developers.

## Pros & Cons  

### Pros  
- Cloud-based: accessible from any device with no installation needed  
- Real-time collaboration: multiple team members can edit and comment simultaneously  
- Easy handoff to developers with inspect tools and CSS export  
- Version control and design history tracking  
- Large plugin ecosystem and community support  

### Cons  
- Requires an internet connection for full functionality  
- Limited offline capabilities compared to native tools  
- Free tier has some limitations for teams (e.g., fewer version history or project slots)
