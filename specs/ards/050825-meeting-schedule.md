# Meeting Schedule
## Date: 5/8/2025

## Context/Problem
We didn’t have a concrete meeting time. Meetings were planned the day of and people did not get much prior notice other than a slack ping about it.

## Options Considered
We had various spontaneous meetings throughout the week on Zoom, but not everyone has been able to show up, and it was hard to get everyone on the same page
- Zoom meeting everyday or every other day at 9pm
- In person after class
- Monday at 4pm in person

## Decision & Outcome
- Long Form Meetings: Thursdays after class (mandatory besides Alan) (6:30 PM), Tuesdays (supplementary)
- Short Form Meetings: 3 times a week everybody replies to a thread in #meeting-minutes about what they’ve done, blockers, and what they plan to do. This can be compiled later.
## Pros & Cons
- Pros
  - Easy to meet in person after class since people go to class
  - Flexibility with short form meetings since it is in message form
- Cons
  - Short form meetings may be lacking in bigger context
  - Alan won’t be able to go one of the big meeting
