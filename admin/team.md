Team Page
In a previous lab exercise you made individual developer pages; now it is time to make one for your team.  This page will be for internal documentation, so ordinarily we would use a Wiki as opposed to GitHub Pages for your project since they are more internally focused.  Since Wikis are a paid feature for teams however, you'll just create a Markdown page in your /admin folder called team.md. You should link to this file from the README.md in your repository root.

Your team page should have the team name, brand, any values you think are important, and a roster of all the team members.  The roster should provide a brief overview of each member with a link to their personal Github page.  The team page can include humor or whatever culture makes sense to your team, but keep it reasonable as it may be shown to others.

I'm interested in abstract mathematics and high-performance computing, and many of my past projects have been about the intersection between the two. In my free time, I like to study, play video games with my friends, and read manga.
| Alan Shapow                | 4th Year Math-CS Major         | [503525](https://github.com/503525)                     | In 2023, I entered UCSD as a Math-CS Major in the hopes that I'd mostly focus on computer science. This decision led me to discovering an unexpected passion in mathematics. Outside of academics, I am *big* into music. I love widening my musical horizons, and I am always listening to new genres and styles. I also enjoy music composition and production. My other hobbies include reading, writing, and as of recently, learning new languages.

I was always a computer geek growing up, and it was high school where my friends and I tried out Computer Science, going to hackathons and having fun in a team. College solidified my desire to study comp sci, giving me a chance not just to learn, but meet all sorts of people. When I find free time, I like to read (currently Dune, but usually anything sci-fi/murder mystery/political science), skateboard (trying to get better), and work out with my friends
