Team Page
In a previous lab exercise you made individual developer pages; now it is time to make one for your team.  This page will be for internal documentation, so ordinarily we would use a Wiki as opposed to GitHub Pages for your project since they are more internally focused.  Since Wikis are a paid feature for teams however, you'll just create a Markdown page in your /admin folder called team.md. You should link to this file from the README.md in your repository root.

Your team page should have the team name, brand, any values you think are important, and a roster of all the team members.  The roster should provide a brief overview of each member with a link to their personal Github page.  The team page can include humor or whatever culture makes sense to your team, but keep it reasonable as it may be shown to others.
