## Meeting Agenda

### Narrowing our Scope

   - The primary piece of feedback we received from Rashi is that we need to reduce the scope of our project a little. 
     - We must consider a narrow **target audience** - who is going to be using our app?
     - Some examples of the above include:
       - A card app specifically for *actors memorizing scripts*.
       - A study app specifically for *UCSD Students*.
       - A vocabulary app for language learners.
   - We are still set to do a general flashcard app, where cards have fronts and backs, and a few features
     - (e.g. card creation, daily practice routines, etc.)

### User Stories and Further Planning

- We already discussed user stories before - but we will want to revisit this with with greater specificity once we have a more clearly defined set of target users.

## Talking Points

### Target Audience: Brainstorm

1. **Actors & Line Memorization**
    - User Stories /  Use Cases:
      - Slam Poet: 
        - In poetry and in acting, line order matters. This user would benefit from a structured study approach that allows them to group lines based on context, rather than studying random lines one after another, to keep everything coherent.
      - Study Partner:
        - When you think of people practicing acting, you imagine people going off of each other, and so having cards with audio cues would replicate this in a way.
      - Acting Review:
        - Voice actors often record themselves in order to get a more objective feel for how they sound. Incorporating audio recordings into study sessions would be useful for this audience.
    - Possible Features:
      - Automatic Parsing of a script
        - (This feature requires research into script formatting)
      - Audio Cues
        - Audio could be used as a prompt for the user to respond to - mimicking a practice partner.
        - Audio can be input as audio files, or perhaps text to speech by default.
      - Cards should be customizable to some degree.
      - Organization features would be important.
        - Bookmarks
        - Categories
        - Decks
    - What would a card look like?
      - Someone suggested that this should be up to the user.
2. **Speech Rehearsal**
    - *Note:* Learning a speech is often already done with cards.
    - Speeches may be easier to split by content than scripts are.
    - Possible Use Cases:
      - Line Memorization
        - This could be useful for speeches that are memorized word-for-word.
      - Presentation Cues
        - With slides on one side, and speech content on the back, a user would be able to practice giving a speech based on their own visual aids.
        - Such a format would also be useful for giving live virtual presentations.
      - General Speech Rehearsal
        - Often, speeches are not memorized in terms of *individual lines*, but rather in broader talking points. Some do this with physical flash cards, and these methods can be easily ported here.
3. **Language / Vocab**
    - We did not discuss this in depth.

### Group Contract

The **Group Contract** is essentially just a group charter where we essentially just come up with the group's values and rules.

We want everything to be clearly defined, from purpose and objectives, to accountability structures and conflict resolution, to standards and communication protocols.

A [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZqrrvAaG75reX3-wduyTIikAkQ_mhTmqS12GLxoW_n0/edit?usp=sharing) was created for the purposes of drafting this document.

*Note: The above hyperlink links to an external site (docs.google.com)*



## TODOs:

- [ ] We want to **finalize our scope**.
   - See the poll in ***#general***.
- [ ] We want everyone to at least look at our [**contract**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZqrrvAaG75reX3-wduyTIikAkQ_mhTmqS12GLxoW_n0/edit?usp=sharing).
- [ ] This week, we want to wireframe the basic card functionality and then implement it in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - It should have simple CRUD capabilities and some sort of "flipping" mechanic. These things will be useful regardless of narrowed scope.
- [ ] We should do the pipeline portion of this week's assignment
  - **Warning:** We may need to settle on an idea *before* we can do this.

## Summary

In this meeting, we discussed ideas for narrowing down the scope of our project. We came up with three ideas: 
1. A card app that helps acrtors memorize their lines.
2. A card app that helps people memorize or rehearse for a speech or presentation
3. A vocabulary / language learning card app.

There is an active poll in ***#general*** to help us make the final decision.

We also introduced the [**Group Contract**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZqrrvAaG75reX3-wduyTIikAkQ_mhTmqS12GLxoW_n0/edit?usp=sharing), which anyone can contribute to for now.
