## ðŸŒ€ Sprint Retrospective

### ðŸŸ¢ What Went Well

**Communication & Coordination**
- Slack responses were quick and helpful across subteams.
- HTML and CSS collaboration improved after merging roles.
- Meeting minutes helped highlight where more effort was needed (e.g., DevOps).

**Technical Progress**
- JS team made strong progress on function completion and testing.
- CSS team finalized most of their components.
- Manual testing moved forward with actual in-app validation.
- Review requirements on pull requests helped maintain code quality.

**Ownership & Initiative**
- Loreen and Audrey were proactive in syncing up and finalizing CSS.
- Taha took initiative to finish functions and start testing.
- DevOps base functionality was completed and deployed early.

### ðŸ”µ What Could Be Improved

**Communication & Visibility**
- Critical updates (e.g., Git branch changes) weren't always shared in time.
- Too many decisions and clarifications are happening in private DMs.
- HTML delays blocked CSS and JS progress â€” public visibility wouldâ€™ve helped.

**Scheduling & Coordination**
- Optional meetings resulted in missed updates during a critical sprint.
- Final exams and midterms reduced team-wide availability and sync.

**DevOps & Feedback Loops**
- Lack of feedback left DevOps unsure how to improve pipeline or tooling.
- Some team members unsure how to contribute or set up testing environments.
