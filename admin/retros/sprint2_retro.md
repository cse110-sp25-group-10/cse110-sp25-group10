# ğŸŒ€ Sprint Retrospective

## ğŸŸ¢ What Went Well

### Javascript Functionality
- Successfully completed all core **CRUD operations**.
- Rendering functionality is mostly done (minor fixes remain).
- Event delegation was discussed and considered for future improvements.
- Unit tests were written for:
  - `Create Card`
  - `Delete Card`
  - `Create Deck`
  - Other CRUD functions (except `Shuffle`)
- Taha added additional tests for his code.

### CSS/HTML Progress
- The **Home Page** is completed (buttons still need work).
- HTML and CSS teams have now **merged** for better workload distribution.

### General
- Focus on sprint priorities was strong.
- Clear direction for next sprint is already in place.

## ğŸ”µ What Could Be Improved

### Communication & Collaboration
- At least **three merge conflicts** occurred just the morning of the meeting.
- Inconsistent communication between team members.
- Some **old/deprecated code** in the repository caused confusion.
- Clarification was needed for the `Delete Card` function's expected behavior.

### Testing & Feedback
- Manual **end-to-end testing** still needs to be integrated.
- Current UI feedback relies on **alert dialogs** â€” better methods like red borders or inline error messages should be implemented.
